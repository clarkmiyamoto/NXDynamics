# network_dynamics
Run discrete &amp; continuous time evolution on networks.

# To Do
- `SimulationData`
    - [ ] Test functionality of `save()` and `load()`
    - [ ] Integrate `SimulationData` container into `time_evolution\discrete_base.py`.
- Time Evolution 
    - [ ] Make NB Theory simulator. At https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=CY0fIXsAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=CY0fIXsAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC
    - [ ] Make parent class for continuous time evolution in `time_evolution\continuous_base.py`

# Features to eventually make 
Ranked from most important to least.
- [ ] Data analysis tools. I.e. plot dynamics of single node / edge / etc.
- [ ] After running simulation, use simulation data make `.gif` of network evolving
